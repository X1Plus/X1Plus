.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vmcore-dmesg
.RI " vmcore"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBvmcore-dmesg\fP extracts the dmesg from a vmcore and write it to
standard out. \fBvmcore-dmesg\fP works against either
\fB/proc/vmcore\fP in a crash dump capture context or a copy
of \fB/proc/vmcore\fP that has been saved for later analysis. A
single build of \fBvmcore-dmesg\fP should work against any linux
vmcore written created on any architecture.

.\"These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
.\"options starting with two dashes (`-').
.\"A summary of options is included below.
.\"For a complete description, see the Info files.
