Actions trigger mechanism

Many different things on the X1 system need to take actions.  For instance,
the on-board buttons have long been customizable with fixed actions, but
there has been some demand to have them do more interesting things.  The
actions mechanism solves this by adding a command set that can affect
various parts of the system.  Additionally, the G-code interpreter can now
be interrupted and send messages in real-time synchronously with the G-code
stream from a print (see x1plus.mcproto).

The actions trigger mechanism operates on JSON; an action is either a list
of actions, or a dictionary with exactly one key (representing the name of
an action), mapping to a parameter of type depending on the action.  A list
executes each subaction in sequence, waiting for action completion.  For
instance, consider the following JSON objects, that would all be conceivably
valid actions, if their respective keys were implemented:

  { "buzzer": { "duration": 0.2 } }
  
  [ { "shutter": true }, { "delay": 1 }, { "gcode": "M400 W0" } ]
  
  { "led": { "animation": "green", "timeout": 5 } }
  
  [ { "buzzer": { "duration": 0.2 } },
    { "display": { "message": "The nozzle is ready for cold pull.  Apply tension on the filament, then tap OK.", "wait_for_confirmation": true } },
    { "gcode": "M400 W0" } ]

At some point in the future, it probably would be reasonable to write a
predicate mechanism, for actions such as `{"if": {"condition":
PREDICATE_OBJECT, "then": ACTION}}`, or `{"wait_until": {"condition":
PREDICATE_OBJECT}}`.  For now, actions run in a straight line.

It would probably be ergonomic to write action scripts in YAML and convert
them to JSON before embedding them in G-code.
